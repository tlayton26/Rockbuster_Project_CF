The first query was to find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers.

SELECT AVG(total_amount_spent)AS Average
FROM
    (SELECT B.first_name, B.last_name, d.city, e.country, SUM (A.amount)AS total_amount_paid
    FROM Payment A
    INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
    INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
    INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
    INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_ID = E.country_ID
    WHERE D.city IN ('Aurora','Acua','Citrus Heights','Iwaki', 'Ambattur','Shanwei','So Leopoldo', 'Teboksary','Tianjin','Cianjur')
    GROUP BY B.first_name,B.last_name, city, country
    LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid
 
 -- 
 
 The Second Query displays how may of the top 5 customers are based within each country. 
 
 SELECT E.Country, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT B.customer_id) AS all_customer_count, 
    COUNT(top_5_customers) AS top_5_customers 
 FROM customer B 
 INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id 
 INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id 
 INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_ID = E.country_ID 
 LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, d.city, e.country, SUM (A.amount)AS total_amount_paid 
    FROM Payment A 
    INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id 
    INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id 
    INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id 
    INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_ID = E.country_ID 
    WHERE D.city IN ('Aurora','Acua','Citrus Heights','Iwaki', 'Ambattur','Shanwei','So Leopoldo','Teboksary','Tianjin','Cianjur') 
    GROUP BY B.customer_id,B.first_name,B.last_name, city, country 
    ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC 
    LIMIT 5) AS top_5_customers 
 ON B.customer_id = top_5_customers.customer_id 
 GROUP BY E.country 
 ORDER BY top_5_customers DESC, all_customer_count DESC, Country
