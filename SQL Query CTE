First to define demnstrate the definition of the CTE

WITH category_name_cte (film_id, rating, category_name) AS
  (SELECT A.film_id,
          A.rating,
          C.name
   FROM film A
   LEFT JOIN film_category B ON A.film_id = B.film_id
   LEFT JOIN category C ON B.category_id = C.category_id)

To demonstrate the entire query that will produce how many times film ratings occur in each film category. 

WITH category_name_cte (film_id, rating, category_name) AS
  (SELECT A.film_id,
          A.rating,
          C.name
   FROM film A
   LEFT JOIN film_category B ON A.film_id = B.film_id
   LEFT JOIN category C ON B.category_id = C.category_id)
SELECT rating,
       category_name,
       COUNT(film_id) AS cnts
FROM category_name_cte
GROUP BY 1,
         2
ORDER BY rating,
         cnts DESC
